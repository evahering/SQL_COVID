# SQL Covid Data Practice

This is a SQL query I did for practice using Covid data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).

I analysed the infection and death rates compared to populations of different copuntries, I found the countries and continents with the highest death count and created a temporary table
showing the rolling deaths and vaccinations per day.

Later I used Tableu to create a [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/eva.hering/viz/CovidData_16582242758820/Dashboard1) and visualise my findings:
